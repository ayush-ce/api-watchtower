## Connector Metadata

Connector details are fetched from the Celigo Integrator API. Set the
environment variables `INTEGRATOR_API_BASE_URL` and `INTEGRATOR_API_KEY`
before running the application. The `ConnectorMetadataService` class
provides helper methods to retrieve all connectors or a specific
connector by its id.
